<h1>UPSC Self-Study Strategy</h1>
<p><strong>A concept-first, standard-source approach to preparing for UPSC.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Self-Study Matters</h2>
<p>
UPSC preparation requires clarity of concepts, ability to connect ideas, and
discipline over time. Self-study allows learners to control pace, focus on
understanding, and follow a sustainable preparation path.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Core Principle: Concepts Before Coverage</h2>
<p>
UPSC rewards depth of understanding, not speed of completion.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
First understand concepts clearly. Only then expand coverage and revision.
</strong>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 1: Read NCERTs (Foundation)</h2>
<p>
NCERTs introduce key political, economic, social, and historical ideas in a
simple and logical manner. They build the foundation for all further study.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 2: Read Standard Books (Consolidation)</h2>
<p>
Standard books deepen understanding and provide structured, exam-relevant
coverage. They should be approached only after NCERTs are understood.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 3: Integrate Current Affairs</h2>
<p>
Current affairs act as an application layer over static concepts. Conceptual
clarity helps in analysing issues rather than memorising news.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 4: Continuously Refer to Syllabus and PYQs</h2>
<p>
The syllabus and previous year questions should be referred to throughout the
preparation process. They define boundaries, depth, and recurring themes.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Role of Lectures</h2>
<p>
Lectures are support tools that help clarify concepts and organise information.
They should assist reading, not replace it.
</p>

<p>
Conceptual lectures are available on the

</strong>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Revision</h2>
<p>
Revision strengthens understanding and improves retention. It should be regular,
concept-focused, and planned.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>
UPSC preparation is ultimately an exercise in thinking. A clear self-study
strategy reduces confusion, improves consistency, and builds confidence.
